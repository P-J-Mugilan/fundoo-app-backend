# Fundoo Application Backend

Fundoo is a high-performance, collaborative note-taking web application backend modeled after Google Keep. It provides a RESTful API for managing user profiles, stateless JWT-based authentication, rich-text notes (with pins, archivals, trashing, and custom colors), labels, and real-time collaboration features supported by background schedulers and cache layers.

## Pre-Running Checklist (Must Check Before Running!)

Before you compile and run the application, make sure the following checklist is completed:

### 1. Database Configuration
* **MySQL Server**: Ensure your MySQL server is running.
* **Database Setup**: You must create a database named `fundoo_db` before launching the app:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE fundoo_db;
  ```
* **Credentials**: The application uses profile-specific settings. Check the configurations in [application-dev.properties](file:///d:/BridgeLabz/MagicSoftware/fundoo/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties):
  * **Default Username**: `root`
  * **Default Password**: `Passwd@123`
  * **URL**: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fundoo_db`
  *(If your local MySQL credentials differ, please update this file before running).*

### 2. Caching Configuration
* **Redis Server**: The application uses Redis for cache management. Ensure Redis is running on port `6379`.
  * Command to verify Redis: `redis-cli ping` (should respond with `PONG`).

### 3. Event Broker & Messaging
* **Apache Kafka**: The application uses Kafka for processing registration events, reminders, and audit logs.
  * Ensure ZooKeeper and Kafka Broker are running locally at `localhost:9092`.
  * The application will automatically construct the required topics (`user-events`, `reminder-alerts`, `audit-logs`) upon startup.

### 4. Java SDK Version
* **JDK Version**: Make sure your local JDK version is set to **Java 21**.
  * Verify in terminal: `java -version`
  * Verify `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your Java 21 path (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.11` on Windows).

### 5. Seeded Admin Account
* On startup, the application checks if an admin user exists. If not, it automatically seeds:
  * **Email**: `admin@fundoo.com`
  * **Password**: `AdminPassword@123`
  * **Role**: `ROLE_ADMIN`

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Architecture

* **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.5.x
* **Language**: Java 21
* **Security**: Stateless Spring Security via JWT
* **Persistence**: Spring Data JPA & Hibernate
* **Database**: MySQL 8.x
* **Cache**: Spring Data Redis
* **Messaging**: Spring Kafka
* **Scheduler**: Spring Boot Scheduler (handles active reminder checking)

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Option A: Running Locally (Bare Metal)

Follow these steps to build, test, and run the backend locally:

#### 1. Compile Code
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

#### 2. Run Test Suite
```bash
mvn test
```

#### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The server will start on **`http://localhost:8080`**.

---

### Option B: Running with Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended)

To run the entire ecosystem (Spring Boot application, MySQL, Redis, and Kafka) with a single command:

#### Prerequisites
* Ensure Docker and Docker Desktop are installed and running.

#### 1. Spin Up the Full Stack
Run the following command from the project root:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This command automatically builds the Spring Boot image using the [Dockerfile](file:///d:/BridgeLabz/MagicSoftware/fundoo/Dockerfile), pulls the latest MySQL 8.0, Redis, and Kafka (KRaft mode) images, and starts all services in the background.

> [!NOTE]
> The Spring Boot application service (`app`) utilizes healthchecks to guarantee it only initializes after `mysql`, `redis`, and `kafka` are fully healthy.

#### 2. Verify Services are Running
```bash
docker compose ps
```
The application will be accessible at **`http://localhost:8080`**.

#### 3. Stop and Clean the Environment
To stop the containers and delete the volumes (wipes database and cache):
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

The project includes a production-grade, declarative [Jenkinsfile](file:///d:/BridgeLabz/MagicSoftware/fundoo/Jenkinsfile) to automate building, testing, packaging, and publishing Docker images.

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Checkout**: Pulls the latest code from the source control management system.
2. **Build & Test**: Automatically detects the platform and runs `./mvnw clean test` (or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows), executing unit tests.
3. **Post-Test Reporting**: Automatically parses JUnit test XMLs and aggregates JaCoCo code coverage report details directly into Jenkins.
4. **Package**: Compiles the final executable Spring Boot Fat JAR.
5. **Docker Build**: Builds the local Docker image using the project's [Dockerfile](file:///d:/BridgeLabz/MagicSoftware/fundoo/Dockerfile).
6. **Docker Push**: Authenticates using Jenkins credentials and pushes the image tagged with the `BUILD_NUMBER` and `latest` to the Docker registry (triggered only on the `main` branch).
7. **Deploy Staging**: Performs a rolling update or executes deployment scripts (triggered only on the `main` branch).

### Prerequisites for Jenkins Server
Ensure the following plugins are installed and configured on your Jenkins controller:
- **Docker Pipeline** (for Docker steps)
- **Pipeline Utility Steps** (for platform detection)
- **JUnit Plugin** (for test results rendering)
- **JaCoCo Plugin** (for code coverage charts)
- **Credentials Binding Plugin** (for secure Docker login credentials)
